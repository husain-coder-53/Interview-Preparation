- **Functional**:
  - **Core Features**: Define the essential features that the system must provide, such as specific UI components, user interactions, and workflows.
  
  - **User Roles**: Outline different user roles and their permissions within the system.
  
  - **Integrations**: Specify integrations with other systems, APIs, or third-party services.
  
  - **User Interface**: Define the required UI elements, such as buttons, forms, modals, and navigation.
  
  - **Behavior**: Describe how the system should behave under different conditions (e.g., error handling, state management).
  
- **Non-Functional Requirements**

  - **Responsiveness**: Ensuring the UI is responsive across different devices and screen sizes.
    
  - **Accessibility**: Adhering to accessibility standards to make the system usable for everyone.
  
  - **Performance**: Optimizing load times, resource usage, and overall system efficiency.
  
  - **Durability**: Ensuring the system can handle expected loads and usage patterns without degradation.
  
  - **Aesthetics**: Maintaining a consistent and visually appealing design.
  
  - **Security**: Implementing measures to protect the system and user data from threats, including encryption, authentication, and authorization mechanisms. Refer to the [Security Standards for System Design](https://github.com/somewhere/UI-System-Design/blob/main/Security%20Standards%20for%20System%20Design.md) for more details.
