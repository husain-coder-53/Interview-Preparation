# RAPID-FAB for UI System Design

<details>
<summary>**R: Requirements**</summary>

- **Functional**:
  - Define UI components required.
  - Specify interactions and behaviors.
  - Identify target devices/browsers.
  
- **Non-Functional**:
  - Responsiveness.
  - Accessibility requirements (e.g., WCAG compliance).
  - Performance targets (e.g., load time, FPS).
</details>

<details>
<summary>**A: Analysis**</summary>

- Compare different UI frameworks/libraries.
- Evaluate component reusability.
- Analyze potential trade-offs (e.g., between performance and ease of use).
</details>

<details>
<summary>**P: Product Scoping**</summary>

- Define the scope of UI components (whatâ€™s included/excluded).
- Outline interaction patterns (e.g., modal dialogs, forms).
- Specify design system elements (e.g., typography, color schemes).
</details>

<details>
<summary>**I: Implementation Strategy**</summary>

- Define the component architecture (e.g., atomic design).
- Plan state management (e.g., Redux, Context API).
- Detail integration points with back-end services or APIs.
</details>

<details>
<summary>**D: Design Considerations**</summary>

- **Performance**:
  - Optimize rendering paths (e.g., virtual DOM, avoiding re-renders).
  - Implement lazy loading and code splitting.
  - Use memoization to avoid unnecessary calculations.
  - Apply efficient animation techniques (e.g., CSS transitions, GPU acceleration).

- **Accessibility**:
  - Use semantic HTML.
  - Ensure keyboard navigation.
  - Apply ARIA roles appropriately.
  - Validate color contrast and text readability.
</details>

<details>
<summary>**F: Feasibility and Scalability**</summary>

- Ensure UI components can scale with increasing data and user interactions.
- Consider future extensibility of the design system.
- Plan for internationalization/localization if needed.
</details>

<details>
<summary>**A: Accessibility**</summary>

- Reinforce the use of ARIA standards.
- Ensure screen reader compatibility.
- Address any accessibility issues during the design and development phases.
- Regularly audit the UI for accessibility improvements.
</details>

<details>
<summary>**B: Business Value**</summary>

- Connect the UI design decisions to business goals (e.g., user engagement, conversion rates).
- Evaluate the ROI of implementing certain UI features.
- Consider how UI design can impact brand perception.
